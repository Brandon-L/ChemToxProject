# ChemTox Data Management System

This project is a database site that stores chemical and toxicity information by hosting this information through a database and displaying it through a styled front end UI. The interface should allow users to search the database, upload data and perform basic statistical analysis. It supports access from multiple users and maintains data consistency and integrity. It also allows management of user accounts and advanced data search and analysis.
